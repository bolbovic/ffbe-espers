# espers

Things left to do before beta:
- [x] Change the star selector
- [ ] Add the star max for each espers in the db: the generation script should take that db into account and the db should not be in the git, only an example
- [ ] Possibility to share builds would be really good (and not that hard to code, come on).

Ideas to implement:
- Images in center to know what esper we are looking at right away
- Example builds
- GL version
- Figure out translation from what is already translated
- ~~Saving builds?~~ Might need too much db for now.
